          I’m a full-stack software engineer coming from a Quality Assurance
          background in the video games industry. I specialize in leading teams
          to create smart solutions to complex problems. After 5 years in the
          games industry, I’ve learned that I thrive under the pressure of
          hitting deadlines while still maintaining a high-quality work output.
